# word-counter
A C++ program I made to count the frequency of characters in a text file.

## Getting started
In order to use this program, you need to compile the source code into
an executable.

To do this (let me know if this doesn't work):
- All: `clang++ wordCount.cpp -o main -std=c++17`

## To do
- [ ] Do something more with the numbers that are gathered.
